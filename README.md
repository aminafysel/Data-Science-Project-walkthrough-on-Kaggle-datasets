# Data Science Project Walkthrough on Kaggle datasets
Trying different types of machine learning algorithms through well known datasets.
The main aim of this project is to focus on creating machine learning pipelines considering all the life cycle of a Data Science Project.WE will go from data analysis,visualization,feature engineering,feature selection, model selection and deployment.

The datasets were downloaded from the kaggle website https://www.kaggle.com/datasets.

Predicting the Perfect Ratio of Red Wine Ingredients with Machine Learning Algorithms.

##  Context:
The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, consult the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).Here I am trying to predict the quality of wine considering the best features using machine learning models.

Who Survived the Titanic Disaster?

## context: 
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others. Here I am trying to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
